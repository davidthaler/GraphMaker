# Graph Maker

In discrete math and computer science, a graph is a set of nodes plus a set of edges defined as pairs of connected nodes. Graph Maker creates, displays and manipulates graphs. It can also animate the operation of common graph algorithms from computer science over the displayed graphs.             

There are two different front-ends on this project, one based on D3 and SVG,
the other based on HTML5 canvas. They share the data class, Graph, in graph.js, and algorithms.

* [Graph Maker](https://davidthaler.github.io/GraphMaker/graphMaker.html) - This variant uses D3 and SVG in the display.
* [Canvas Graph](https://davidthaler.github.io/GraphMaker/graphMaker.html) - This variant is based on HTML Canvas.
