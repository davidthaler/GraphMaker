# Graph Maker

In discrete math and computer science, a graph is a set of nodes plus a set of edges 
defined as pairs of connected nodes. 
Graph Maker creates, displays and manipulates graphs. 
It can also animate the operation of common graph algorithms over the displayed graphs.        

The [Graph Maker](https://davidthaler.github.io/GraphMaker/graphMaker.html) app and  
[instructions](https://davidthaler.github.io/GraphMaker/) for it are served on Github Pages.
