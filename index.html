        <h2>Graph Maker</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a webapp that allows for creation and modification of graphs, 
            that is, a set of nodes linked by some edges. It can execute common algorithms 
            on graphs and animate their progress on the displayed graph. It also allows for 
            storage of graphs, and downloading images of graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two different front-ends on this project, one based on D3 and SVG,
            the other based on HTML5 canvas. They share the data class, Graph, in graph.js, 
            and algorithms.

                <p>
                    This is a D3-based version of the Graph Maker project.
                    It is more developed, and includes animations of a few graph algorithms.

                <p>
                    Similar to the D3 project above, but implemented with HTML5 canvas. 
                    This project is not as far along.
